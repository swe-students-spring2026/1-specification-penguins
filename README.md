## Stakeholders

Pierson Scheinberg (Tutor):
Goals/Needs: <br />
    1. Set his own rate. <br />
    2. Have a consultation session to see if student is the right match. <br />
    3. Diagnostic test to gauge student's level. <br />
    4. Assurance of payment on time (streamline the process). <br />

Problems: <br />
    1. No knowledge of student's current level of understanding causing time devoted to that. <br />
    2. Poor communication when tutoring with a mentor group involving schedule changes/lack of notice. <br />
    3. Services that hire tutors give a low set rate and don't give tutors much of the money that the services charge clients. <br />
    4. Services assigned people to tutors which sometimes caused mismatches. <br />

Rachel Kim (Student):
Goals/Needs:
    1. Find qualified tutors quickly for specific subjects and levels.
    2. Flexible scheduling that fits personal schedule outside of school.
    3. Personalized learning paths and progress tracking.
    4. “Skill stacking”: blend coursework with real-world projects and portfolio output.
    5. Tutor continuity: keep the same tutor long-term to build momentum.
    6. Advice from someone who had experience with the course 

Problems:
    1. Can't understand well for the content taught by school's professor
    2. The teaching speed at school is impossible to control by student (some prefer faster/slower)
    3. Lack of 1 on 1 learning environment-- customization
    4. Student gets distracted easily within a huge class size
    5. Hard to find help when the class size is huge
    6. Usually can't pay attention for the morning class
    7. Not every class has zoom recording
    8. For office hours, it takes too long to get the spot
