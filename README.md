## Stakeholders

Pierson Scheinberg (Tutor):
Goals/Needs:
    1. Set his own rate. <br />
    2. Have a consultation session to see if student is the right match. <br />
    3. Diagnostic test to gauge student's level. <br />
    4. Assurance of payment on time (streamline the process). <br />

Problems:
    1. No knowledge of student's current level of understanding causing time devoted to that. <br />
    2. Poor communication when tutoring with a mentor group involving schedule changes/lack of notice. <br />
    3. Services that hire tutors give a low set rate and don't give tutors much of the money that the services charge clients. <br />
    4. Services assigned people to tutors which sometimes caused mismatches. <br />
