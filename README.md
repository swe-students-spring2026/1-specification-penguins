## Stakeholders

Pierson Scheinberg (Tutor):
Goals/Needs: <br />
    1. Set his own rate. <br />
    2. Have a consultation session to see if student is the right match. <br />
    3. Diagnostic test to gauge student's level. <br />
    4. Assurance of payment on time (streamline the process). <br />

Problems: <br /> 
    1. No knowledge of student's current level of understanding causing time devoted to that. <br />
    2. Poor communication when tutoring with a mentor group involving schedule changes/lack of notice. <br />
    3. Services that hire tutors give a low set rate and don't give tutors much of the money that the services charge clients. <br />
    4. Services assigned people to tutors which sometimes caused mismatches. <br />

Rosie Wang(Tutor):
Goals:
    1. Finding correct materials for students based on different needs. 
    2. Flexibly designing teaching plans based on each student's level.

Problems:
    1. Issues when communicating with students about their needs, some students aren't clear about what specific areas they need most help with.
    2. Sometimes have to go pass the scheduled session time to finish explaining problems but don't get paid for the extra time.


Rachel Kim (Student): 
Goals/Needs:
     1. Find qualified tutors quickly for specific subjects and levels. 
     2. Flexible scheduling that fits personal schedule outside of school. 
     3. Personalized learning paths and progress tracking. 
     4. “Skill stacking”: blend coursework with real-world projects and portfolio output. 
     5. Tutor continuity: keep the same tutor long-term to build momentum. 
     6. Advice from someone who had experience with the course 

Problems: 
    1. Can't understand well for the content taught by school's professor 
    2. The teaching speed at school is impossible to control by student (some prefer faster/slower) 
    3. Lack of 1 on 1 learning environment-- customization 
    4. Student gets distracted easily within a huge class size 
    5. Hard to find help when the class size is huge 
    6. Usually can't pay attention for the morning class 
    7. Not every class has zoom recording 
    8. For office hours, it takes too long to get the spot

Vicky Zhou(Student):
Goals:
    1. Finding tutors who took the class before and got good grades, preferably with lots of experience.
    2. Need tutors who not only succeeded in the course but also can explain concepts in a way students can understand.  
    3. Finding tutors who can design exercise problems based on each students' needs, instead of giving the same material for students of all levels.

Problems:
    1. Having trouble to verify whether the tutor is experienced or not
    2. Some tutors succeed in the subject, but cannot teach and explain the concepts to someone new. 
    3. The way tutors explain specific problems differ from how the professor teaches in class, bringing conflicts and confusion.
